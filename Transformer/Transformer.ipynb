    "### **B. <i>GPT - a Generative Pre-Trained Transformer</i>**\n",
    "In 2018, OpenAI introduced GPT in [<i>Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training</i>](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/openai-assets/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf) (Radford et al., 2018). \n",
    "The GPT model is based on the Transformer architecture. However, it modifies the original design by discarding the encoder and solely utilizing the decoder part. This adaptation is designed to make GPT **\"Autoregressive\"** in the Generative mode, i.e., predict new tokens conditioning on its own previous predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "##### There is an important distinction between the working of GPT in <i>**Training**</i> mode vs. <i>**Generative**</i> mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "> __in training mode__, the objective of the model is to learn and understand the language. The model is fed huge amounts of text data and its task is to predict the next token in the sequence, given the context of the previous tokens. In training mode, GPT does not generate any new tokens but only predictions. In this mode, the predictions are used to calculate the 'Loss', which is the difference between the model predictions and the actual input tokens, and the loss is used to calculate the required updates to the model learnable parameters through backpropagation \n",
    "\n",
    "> **In generative (or inference) mode**, the objective of the GPT model is to generate new tokens, not only predictions. The process starts by providing a pre-trained model a prompt as an initial input, and the model starts to predict the next tokens given this initial prompt, but then the model continues to predict and generate **new** tokens conditioning on **its own** previous predictions in an <i>autoregressive</i> manner. The new tokens are generated by sampling the next token from the probability distribution generated in the prediction process, based on the probability scores. In this mode, the model's *weights are frozen* and not updated\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This is how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **1. Tokenization**: first, the input text data is tokenized into a sequence of tokens. In the original Transformer paper, the authors used a byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer, which is similar to the WordPiece tokenizer used in BERT. In the GPT-3 paper, the authors used a byte-level BPE tokenizer, which is similar to the Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer used in GPT-2. In both cases, the tokenizer splits the input text into a sequence of tokens, where each token is a subword unit (e.g., a word, a character, or a subword). The tokenizer may also add special tokens to the beginning and end of the sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "> **2. Token Embeddings**: after tokenization, each token is converted into an **embedding vector**. The concept of Word Embedding was introduced by Mikolov et al., 2013 in the **Word2Vec** paper [<i>Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality</i>](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf). In the original GPT paper, the size of the embedding vector is 768; in GPT-3, the size is 1,248. in general, the larger the embedding vector, the more information the model can capture about the language. The representation of each token by a long embedding vector aims to capture the semantic information of the token in the context of the language as a whole. The embeddings represent the inherent properties and meaning of the token based on its co-occurrence patterns and relationships with other tokens in the training data. The token embeddings are part of the model's learnable parameters, and during the training process, the embeddings are updated through backpropagation in each batch iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **3. Positional Encoding**: the embedding vectors are passed through a positional encoding layer, which adds positional information to the embedding vectors. This positional information is important for the model to understand the order of the tokens in the input sequence. The resulting matrix, containing both the embedding vectors and positional encodings, is fed as input **(X)** into the Transformer's first Transformer block.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **4. Transformer Blocks** - GPT applies __multiple__ Transformer Blocks over the input sequences. Each Transformer Block applies the following layers in sequence:  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='https://github.com/rashlab/AI-Notes/raw/main/filez/selfatten.png' width=200px />\n",
    "\n",
    ">>  4.1 **Masked Multi-Head Attention layer**: Computes self-attention weights and generates a new representation of the input sequence (see part **C.** below)\n",
    "\n",
    ">>  4.2 **Add & Norm** - Adds Residual Connection to the input to the Self-Attention Layer and then apply Layer Normalization (see note below)\n",
    "\n",
    ">>  4.3 **Feed-Forward layer** Applies a <i>pointwise</i> feed-forward layer independently to each vector in the sequence. (\"pointwise\" means that the FFN operates on each token in the input sequence independently, without considering the other tokens in the sequence; this is in contrast to the convolutional layers in CNNs, which operate on a local neighborhood of the input sequence, or the recurrent layers in RNNs, which operate on the entire input sequence at once)\n",
    "\n",
    ">>  4.4 **Add & Norm** - same as in step 4.2\n",
    "\n",
    "> **5. The output of the Transformer blocks** - the self-attention block's output represent each of the input tokens, similar to the input token embedding, but they capture different aspects of the token's context. The input token embedding is responsible for representing the token's general meaning in the language, while the output of the Transformer blocks is a more refined representation of the token, which takes into account its specific contextual relationships with all other tokens in the input sequence. This output vector reflects the model's understanding of the token's role and significance within the given sequence, considering the broader context, dependencies, and interactions with other input tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "> **6. The output of the GPT Model** - the output of the last Transformer block is passed through a Linear layer, which generates a **<i>logits vector</i>**, where each element in the logits vector is a scalar (a single numerical value) that represents the model's unnormalized confidence for the corresponding token in the vocabulary being the next token. The size of the logits vector is equal to the size of the vocabulary of the model. The logits are passed through a Softmax layer, which creates a probability distribution over the vocabulary for each token in the input sequence. From here, the working of the model depends on its mode of operation:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>    6.1 in Training mode, the Softmax normalization output is fed into a Cross-Entropy Loss function, which computes the loss by comparing the model prediction (\"what is the next token?\") to the actual next token in the input sequence. This loss is then used to update the model learnable parameters through backpropagation (after each batch iteration).\n",
    "\n",
    ">>    6.2 in Generative/Inference mode, the purpose is to generate a new token, the selection of which is made by sampling from the Softmax normalization output, using methods such as top-k or top-p sampling, or other sampling techniques like beam search. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Some notes on the above:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **the Feed-Forward layer (FFN)** - this is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), consisting of two linear (dense) layers with a non-linear activation function, such as GeLU (Gaussian Error Linear Units) in between. The purpose of this FFN is to introduce non-linearity into the model and combine features learned by the self-attention mechanism. The first linear layer of the FFN increases the dimensionality of the input (commonly X4), while the second linear layer reduces it back to the original dimension. The non-linear activation function helps the model capture complex relationships in the data. \n",
    ">> Feed-forward layers constitute two-thirds of a transformer modelâ€™s parameters, yet their role in the network remains under-explored. In recent work, researchers show that feed-forward layers in transformer-based language models have a central role in the **memory** capabilities of the model (the \"Neural Memory\") - see [Transformer Feed-Forward Layers Are Key-Value Memories (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.446.pdf) and [the ROME project](https://rome.baulab.info/)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Residual Connections** - In the GPT model, residual connections are found in two places within each Transformer block: the Self-Attention layer and the Feed-Forward layer. The purpose of these residual connections is to help the model learn more efficiently, by allowing gradients to flow more easily through the network during backpropagation, and mitigating the vanishing gradient problem that can occur in deep architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Layer Normalization** - this layer apply normalization to the output values (the \"activations\") of the self-attention layer and the output values of the FFN by the mean and variance of the these activatations. This normalization technique helps the model learn more efficiently, by allowing gradients to flow more easily through the network during backpropagation, and mitigating the vanishing gradient problem that can occur in deep architectures. In PyTorch, layer normalization can be implemented using the ```torch.nn.LayerNorm``` module, which takes the number of features (neurons) as input and applies normalization across these features. <i>(note: \"activations\" typically refers to the output values of the current layer, before the activation function is applied)</i>\n",
    ">> in the original paper, the first nn.LayerNorm is applied after the attention layer (Post-LN), in other implementations the first nn.LayerNorm is applied before the attention layer (Pre-LN). Karpathy used the Pre-LN version, which is more common today (```x = x + self.attn(self.ln_1(x))```). \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Dropout** - dropout regularization technique works by randomly \"dropping out\" or setting a fraction of the neurons to zero during training, forcing the network to learn more robust features. In the Transformer architecture and GPT, dropout is typically applied at several points: (i) after the Self-Attention layer - after computing the self-attention scores and generating a new representation of the input sequence, dropout is applied to the output before the first Add & Norm; (ii) after the Feed-Forward layer - after applying the FFN to each vector in the sequence, dropout is applied to the output before the second Add & Norm; and (iii) in the Multi-Head Attention - dropout can also be applied to the attention scores before they are used to compute the weighted sum of the value vectors\n"

    "### C. **<i>The Multi-Head Masked Attention</i>**\n",
    "\n",
    " Self-Attention is the fundamental operation of the Transformer. It is designed to weigh and relate the tokens of the input sequence to better capture the relationships and dependencies between them, by computing scores for each pair of elements in the input sequence. These scores determine how much \"attention\" each element should pay to other elements in the sequence. Higher scores indicate stronger relationships between elements, while lower scores suggest weaker relationships. \n",
    "\n",
    " The Self-Attention mechanism transforms each token, initially represented by its embedding and positional encoding vector, into three vectors: a query vector (Q), a key vector (K), and a value vector (V). This transformation is achieved by applying linear transformations, specifically by multiplying the input sequence of the embedding vectors (X) with their corresponding weight matrices (W_Q, W_K, and W_V). In PyTorch, linear transformations can be implemented using the ```torch.nn.Linear``` module, which takes the number of input features and the number of output features as input. more on this [here](https://github.com/rashlab/AI-Notes/blob/main/nn.Linear/nn.Linear.ipynb). (note: the authors of <i>Attention Is All You Need</i> introduced the Query/Key/Value concept, drawing an analogy to a retrieval system, which might be somewhat confusing.) \n",

    "> **Attention Scores** are computed by multiplying each Q vector with each K vector. This is done by taking the dot product between the Q matrix and the transpose of K matrix. Since the softmax that will be applied next can be sensitive to very large input values that kill the gradient and slow down learning, we divide by the square root of the embedding dimension, so attention scores (```att```) are computed as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "```att = (q @ k.transpose(-2, -1)) * (1.0 / math.sqrt(k.size(-1)))```\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "```att = F.softmax(att, dim=-1)```\n",

    "\n",
    "> The output O is a matrix of the same shape as the input X - each output vector represents a single input token and has the same size as the embedding and positional encoding vectors \n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary, the attention mechanism in GPT uses learned weight matrices (W_Q, W_K, W_V) to transform the input sequence into query, key, and value vectors, then uses the dot product of the query and key tensors to compute attention weights, which are used to compute a weighted sum of the value vector to produce the output.**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Some notes on the above:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Multi-Head Attention** - In each Transformer block, the Self-Attention is conducted multiple times using Multi-Head Attention, by dividing the Q, K, and V vectors into multiple subspaces (or \"heads\"), and applying the attention mechanism independently to each subspace, and then concatenates the results back into a single vector. This approach allows the model to focus on various relationships within the data simultaneously, leading to more expressive and powerful contextual representations. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Causal Attention Mask** - the attention mechanism in GPT uses an attention mask to prevent the model from attending to tokens that come after the current token in the input sequence. Masking is done by creating a triangular matrix where the lower triangular part is preserved, and the upper triangular part is masked. As a result, when the model processes a given token, it can only attend to the tokens that came before it or the current token itself, but not the future tokens.This is crucial for maintaining a **causal structure** to preventing information leakage from future tokens during training and inference, and enforcing the autoregressive property and causal structure of the model. The attention mask triangle is applied on the Attention Scores, before the Softmax operation, by setting the values of the cells we want to mask to -infinity. \n",
